# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shane @shane-ducksbury
## I build Web Apps, API's and create code to solve problems.
#### This is my Github that I use for university and personal projects.
I'm a full stack developer with skills in Angular, React, Express and Java. In a previous career I was a systems administrator. I have a keen interest in all things tech, but mainly cloud and open source. I'm a big fan of usability, and am currently finishing my degree in Interaction Design at University of Canberra.

I also like lots of other things, like old Macs (pre-Intel), Cities Skylines and tinkering with my home network.
