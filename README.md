# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shane @shane-ducksbury
## I build Web Apps, API's and create code to solve problems.
#### This is my Github that I use for university and personal projects.
I'm a full stack developer with skills in Angular, React, Express and Java. In a previous job I was also a systems administrator.
I also like lots of other things, like open source, Linux, devops and old Macs.

I'm a big fan of usability, and am currently finishing my degree in Interaction Design at University of Canberra.
